        <h1>Form 11</h1>
        <p>
          Form 11 is the self-assessment income tax return used by self-employed
          individuals, landlords, company directors, and others with non-PAYE
          income in Ireland. It is filed annually with the Revenue Commissioners
          to report income, claim tax credits, and calculate tax liabilities.
          Completing Form 11 accurately is crucial to ensuring compliance with
          Irish tax laws and avoiding penalties.
